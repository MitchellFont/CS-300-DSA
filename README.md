  The problem I solved in the projects for this course was for the CS dept at ABC University where they needed software to help its computer science advisors access course information for students. I created pseudocode using different data structures and perfromed runtime analysis on them to determine which would be the best for the final project. Every data structure has advantages and disadvantages to being used. I determined that the binary search tree was the best choice for this and then developed the program. I did not run into any major roadblocks during this project. My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by allowing me to really think about the performance of programs and the use cases of different data structures. My work on this project evolved the way I write programs to always be perfromant and adaptable.
